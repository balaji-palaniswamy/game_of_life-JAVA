Instructions for running the program.

Step 1. Run "Simulation.java" file.

Step 2. CLI will prompt for the 'height' of grid. Enter an integer greater than "3".

Step 3. CLI will prompt for the 'width' of grid. Enter an integer greater than "3".

If you enter a grid of height 4 and width 3 then grid will be following format
            [00 10 20 30 ]
            [01 11 21 31 ]
            [02 12 22 31 ]


Step 4. Choose how you would like to name the cells. If you choose by
        1. user input

            CLI will prompt for the name and state of each cell in order
            row 1 [ 00->10->20->30] then row 2 [01->11->21->31] then row 3 and so on.

            i)  You must provide a unique name for each cell. Program does not allow repetition of names.
            ii) Then select the state of cell
                    1 for Alive
                    0 for dead



        2. Default input
            i) Then the program names the cells automatically by default with names from "0" to max size
             according to the size of grid.
             If the size of grid is of height 5 and width 6
             then [  0  1  2  3  4  5 ]
                  [  6  7  8  9 10 11 ]
                  [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 ]
                  [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 ]
                  [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 ]
             ii) Default input also sets the cells as active.
